# bootstrap-upgrade-from-v-3-to-v-4

## unstable and maybe not working at the moment when you catch this project

Small CSS-class-replacer to change bootstrap v3 markup to v4

In the **upgrade-rules.txt** you can see what kind of markup will be replaced. Lines that starts with an **#** will 
be ignored
